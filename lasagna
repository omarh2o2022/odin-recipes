    <h1>Lasagne Alla Bolognese Saporite</h1>
    <p>This is the classic lasagne alla Bolognese recipe from the Emilia region in Northern Italy. The Bolognese sauce is made with a mixture of beef and pork mince. The addition of prosciutto, red wine, cinnamon, and nutmeg make it truly authentic.</p>

    <div><h1>Lasagna Layers:</h1>
         <ul>
            <li>11 ounces lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>2 ½ cups grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste</li>
         </ul>
        </div>
    <div>    <h1>Directions</h1>
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir onion, carrot, shallot, and prosciutto until onion is translucent and prosciutto releases some fat, about 10 minutes. Add pork and beef; season with 1 teaspoon nutmeg, cinnamon, and salt to taste. Cook and stir over medium-high heat until browned and crumbly, about 10 minutes</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p>Pour red wine over meat mixture; increase heat and cook until wine evaporates, about 3 minutes. Add tomatoes and mix well; bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes break down and flavors of Bolognese sauce have combined, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <p>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat; add flour. Whisk vigorously until mixture is smooth. Pour in milk and cook, stirring occasionally, over medium heat until white sauce thickens enough to cover the back of a spoon, about 10 minutes; season with 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg, salt, and pepper.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Step 4</h3>
        <p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and run under cold water to stop the cooking process. Lay noodles on a clean towel and pat dry.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Step 5</h3>
        <p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Step 6</h3>
        <p>Pour a ladleful of Bolognese sauce and a ladleful of white sauce over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish; top with 3 or 4 lasagna noodles. Cover noodles with 1/3 of the white sauce and 1/3 of the Bolognese sauce. Sprinkle some of the Parmesan cheese on top; cover with lasagna noodles. Repeat layers, ending with white sauce and Parmesan cheese</p>
        
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Step 7</h3>
        <p>Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling and top is golden brown, 30 to 40 minutes. Let stand 3 to 4 minutes before slicing.</p>
